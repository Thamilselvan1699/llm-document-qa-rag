Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence focused on learning patterns from data.
Supervised learning uses labeled data, while unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns.
Common ML algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.
Model evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
